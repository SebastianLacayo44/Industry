# Work

Projects I have completed at work. No PII or sensetive data will be uploaded. Descriptions of the projects below!

# Projects

1. [SlackBot - Rebills](#SlackBot)
2. [Predicting Churn](#Predicting Subscriber Churn)

## Slackbot

I created a Slackbot that takes different forward slash `/` data reporting requests. In particular, this Slackbot request returns the estimated rebill revenue for our subscription product (adjusted for churn) for the current quarter along with realized revenue and the revenue generated by new subscribers.

This project has two files:

1. SlackBotFunctions.py - Which contains all the bot functions ran through Bolt
2. RebillDataFunction.py - Contains the script used to generate all the rebill data
3. SampleOutput - A sample photo of the output


## Predicting Subscriber Churn
